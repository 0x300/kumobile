                Specifically for a bug in iOS 9 where data-rel="back"
                does not work. It is possible that this can be removed in
                the future and is only a work around. It must come after jquery
                import and before jquery mobile import.

                            that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by

                                    <h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

                                    <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
                                    software and other kinds of works.</p>

                                    <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
                                    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
                                    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
                                    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
                                    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
                                    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
                                    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
                                    your programs, too.</p>

                                    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                                    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
                                    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
                                    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

                                    <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
                                    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
                                    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
                                    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

                                    <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                                    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
                                    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
                                    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
                                    know their rights.</p>

                                    <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
                                    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
                                    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

                                    <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
                                    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
                                    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
                                    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
                                    authors of previous versions.</p>

                                    <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
                                    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
                                    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
                                    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
                                    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
                                    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
                                    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
                                    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
                                    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
                                    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

                                    <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
                                    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
                                    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
                                    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
                                    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
                                    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

                                    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                                    modification follow.</p>

                                    <p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

                                    <p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
                                    works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
                                     
                                    <p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
                                    License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
                                    “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>

                                    <p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
                                    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
                                    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
                                    earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>

                                    <p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
                                    on the Program.</p>

                                    <p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
                                    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
                                    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
                                    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
                                    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
                                    public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

                                    <p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
                                    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
                                    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

                                    <p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
                                    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
                                    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
                                    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
                                    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
                                    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
                                    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
                                    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>

                                    <p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
                                    for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
                                    form of a work.</p>

                                    <p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
                                    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
                                    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
                                    is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

                                    <p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
                                    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
                                    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
                                    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
                                    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
                                    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
                                    “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
                                    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
                                    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
                                    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

                                    <p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
                                    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
                                    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
                                    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
                                    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
                                    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
                                    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
                                    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
                                    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
                                    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
                                    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
                                    subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

                                    <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
                                    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
                                    Source.</p>

                                    <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
                                    same work.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

                                    <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
                                    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
                                    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
                                    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
                                    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
                                    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
                                    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

                                    <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
                                    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
                                    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
                                    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
                                    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
                                    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
                                    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
                                    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
                                    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
                                    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

                                    <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
                                    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
                                    makes it unnecessary.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

                                    <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
                                    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
                                    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
                                    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
                                    measures.</p>

                                    <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
                                    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
                                    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
                                    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
                                    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
                                    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
                                    technological measures.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

                                    <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
                                    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
                                    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
                                    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
                                    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
                                    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
                                    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

                                    <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
                                    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

                                    <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
                                    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
                                    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                    <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
                                        it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

                                    <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
                                        released under this License and any conditions added under section
                                        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
                                        “keep intact all notices”.</li>

                                    <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
                                        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
                                        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                                        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                                        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
                                        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                                        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

                                    <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
                                        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
                                        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
                                        work need not make them do so.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
                                    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
                                    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
                                    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
                                    “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
                                    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
                                    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
                                    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

                                    <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
                                    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
                                    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
                                    in one of these ways:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                    <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
                                        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
                                        customarily used for software interchange.</li>

                                    <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                                        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
                                        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
                                        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
                                        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
                                        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
                                        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
                                        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
                                        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
                                        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

                                    <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
                                        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
                                        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
                                        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
                                        with subsection 6b.</li>

                                    <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
                                        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                                        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
                                        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
                                        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
                                        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
                                        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
                                        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
                                        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
                                        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
                                        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
                                        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

                                    <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
                                        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
                                        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
                                        charge under subsection 6d.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
                                    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
                                    included in conveying the object code work.</p>

                                    <p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
                                    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
                                    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
                                    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
                                    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
                                    product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
                                    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
                                    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
                                    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
                                    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
                                    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
                                    the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

                                    <p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
                                    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
                                    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
                                    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
                                    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
                                    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
                                    modification has been made.</p>

                                    <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
                                    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
                                    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
                                    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
                                    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
                                    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
                                    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
                                    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
                                    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
                                    been installed in ROM).</p>

                                    <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
                                    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
                                    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
                                    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
                                    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
                                    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
                                    protocols for communication across the network.</p>

                                    <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
                                    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
                                    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
                                    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
                                    unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

                                    <p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
                                    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
                                    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
                                    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
                                    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
                                    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
                                    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
                                    this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

                                    <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
                                    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
                                    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
                                    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
                                    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
                                    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

                                    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
                                    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
                                    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                    <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
                                        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

                                    <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
                                        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
                                        Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

                                    <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
                                        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
                                        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

                                    <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
                                        authors of the material; or</li>

                                    <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
                                        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

                                    <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                                        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
                                        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
                                        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
                                        those licensors and authors.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
                                    restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
                                    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
                                    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
                                    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
                                    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
                                    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
                                    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
                                    not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

                                    <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
                                    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
                                    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
                                    where to find the applicable terms.</p>

                                    <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
                                    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
                                    the above requirements apply either way.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>

                                    <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
                                    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
                                    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
                                    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
                                    paragraph of section 11).</p>

                                    <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
                                    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
                                    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
                                    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
                                    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
                                    prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

                                    <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                                    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                                    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                                    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                                    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                                    your receipt of the notice.</p>

                                    <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                                    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                                    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                                    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
                                    material under section 10.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

                                    <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
                                    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
                                    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
                                    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
                                    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
                                    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
                                    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
                                    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

                                    <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
                                    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
                                    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
                                    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

                                    <p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
                                    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
                                    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
                                    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
                                    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
                                    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
                                    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
                                    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
                                    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

                                    <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
                                    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
                                    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
                                    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
                                    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
                                    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
                                    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>

                                    <p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
                                    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
                                    work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</p>

                                    <p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
                                    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
                                    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
                                    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
                                    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
                                    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
                                    purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
                                    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
                                    this License.</p>

                                    <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
                                    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
                                    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
                                    propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

                                    <p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
                                    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
                                    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
                                    sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a
                                    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
                                    patent against the party.</p>

                                    <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
                                    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
                                    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
                                    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
                                    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
                                    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
                                    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
                                    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
                                    license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have
                                    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
                                    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
                                    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
                                    country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
                                      
                                    <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
                                    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
                                    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
                                    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
                                    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
                                    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
                                    work and works based on it.</p>

                                    <p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
                                    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
                                    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
                                    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
                                    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
                                    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
                                    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
                                    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
                                    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
                                    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
                                    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
                                    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
                                    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
                                    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

                                    <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
                                    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
                                    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

                                    <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
                                    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
                                    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
                                    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
                                    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
                                    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>

                                    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
                                    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
                                    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
                                    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
                                    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
                                    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
                                    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
                                    combination as such.</p>

                                    <h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

                                    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
                                    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                                    address new problems or concerns.</p>

                                    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
                                    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
                                    Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
                                    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
                                    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
                                    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
                                    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
                                    by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

                                    <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
                                    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
                                    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
                                    to choose that version for the Program.</p>

                                    <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
                                    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
                                    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
                                    later version.</p>

                                    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
                                    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
                                    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
                                    copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

                                    <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

                                    <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                                    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                                    the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

                                    <pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

                                    <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short

                                    such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,

                                    included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
                                    Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
                                    Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
                                    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict
                                    the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
                                    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
                                    terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
                                    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
                                    Collection, but this does not require the Collection
                                    apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
                                    the terms of the Applicable License.</li>
                                    <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or

                                    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
                                    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
                                    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
                                    applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
                                    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
                                    a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
                                    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's

                                    for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
                                    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the
                                    use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
                                    translation of the Work by Original Author," or
                                    "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
                                    The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
                                    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
                                    that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
                                    minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
                                    contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
                                    appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
                                    least as prominent as the credits for the other
                                    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
                                    only use the credit required by this Section for the
                                    purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
                                    by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not

                                    which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
                                    or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those

                                    right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
                                    to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
                                    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
                                    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
                                    reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as

                                    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
                                    to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
                                    this License (right to make Adaptations) but not

                                    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,

                                    referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
                                    terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
                                    Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
                                    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
                                    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
                                    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
                                    revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
                                    matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
                                    the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
                                    the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
                                    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
                                    If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
                                    copyright law includes additional rights not granted

                                        <h2>ODC Open Database License (ODbL)</h2>

                                        <h3>Preamble</h3>

                                        <p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to
                                        allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while
                                        maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by
                                        copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some
                                        jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that
                                        cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,
                                        the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to
                                        act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>

                                        <p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
                                        audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
                                        and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
                                        contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
                                        together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a
                                        single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the
                                        contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should
                                        describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual
                                        record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</p>

                                        <p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
                                        covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
                                        trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
                                        over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may
                                        have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
                                        activities not covered by this License.</p>

                                        <hr>

                                        <p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>

                                        <p>2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A license of the Database Right; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</p>

                                        <p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
                                        Database, including:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.
                                          The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the
                                          Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents
                                          independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright
                                          law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
                                          model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
                                          of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
                                          indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of
                                          Contents stored in the Database;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
                                          Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
                                          Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
                                          from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would
                                          not infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
                                          access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
                                          use on this access as outlined in this License.</p>

                                        <p>2.3 Rights not covered.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
                                          or operation of the Database;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
                                          Database; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database.</p>

                                        <p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
                                        the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
                                        including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
                                        rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
                                        Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.
                                        For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
                                        License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
                                        have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
                                        the rights over the images.</p>

                                        <h3>3.0 Rights granted</h3>

                                        <p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
                                        grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
                                        only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
                                        any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
                                        include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
                                        the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
                                        exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
                                        future.</p>

                                        <p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
                                          the Contents;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Creation of Collective Databases;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
                                          in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
                                          Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
                                          performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
                                          part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Databases.</p>

                                        <p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
                                          which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
                                          compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
                                          the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
                                          of the rights granted under this License;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
                                          which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
                                          compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
                                          exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
                                          the rights granted under this License; and,</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
                                          royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
                                          a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
                                          schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
                                          granted under this License.</p>

                                        <p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
                                        distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that
                                        this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice
                                        of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
                                        10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>

                                        <h3>4.0 Conditions of Use</h3>

                                        <p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to
                                        Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
                                        conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be
                                        in material breach of its terms.</p>

                                        <p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative
                                        Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You
                                        must:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license
                                          permitted under Section 4.4;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license
                                          permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
                                          with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the
                                          Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices
                                          that refer to this License.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular
                                          file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a
                                          location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to
                                          look for it.</p>

                                        <p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced
                                        Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you
                                        Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with
                                        the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,
                                        views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
                                        Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
                                        Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
                                        is available under this License.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under
                                          Section 4.3:</p>

                                        <pre><code>    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available
                                            here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
                                        </code></pre>

                                        <p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
                                        hyperlink to the URI of the Database. “Open Database License” should
                                        contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
                                        hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
                                        required URI’s with the above notice.</p>

                                        <p>4.4 Share alike.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under
                                          the terms of:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. This License;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this
                                              License; or</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. A compatible license.</p>

                                        <p>If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses
                                          mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the
                                          whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a
                                          Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is
                                          Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work
                                          created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,
                                          You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a
                                          that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
                                          compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the
                                          authorised proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a compatible
                                          license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>

                                        <p>4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply
                                        in the following:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license
                                          Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this
                                          Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License
                                          still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of
                                          the Collective Database;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as
                                          part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not
                                          create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is
                                          not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements
                                          of Section 4.4.</p>

                                        <p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative
                                        Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also
                                        offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy
                                        in a machine readable form of:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The entire Derivative Database; or</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or
                                          the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an
                                          algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the
                                          differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>

                                        <p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be
                                        available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical
                                        distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>

                                        <p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to
                                          Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the
                                          Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of
                                          the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any
                                          rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting
                                          the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological
                                          measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a
                                          Substantial part of the Contents (a “Restricted Database”) in
                                          contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the
                                          Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the
                                          Restricted Database:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. That is available without additional fee;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict
                                            the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have
                                            the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to
                                            exercise those rights (an “Unrestricted Database”); and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the
                                            recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a
                                          Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a
                                          password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You
                                          do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights
                                          granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the
                                          ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>

                                        <p>4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time
                                        You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
                                        Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
                                        Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
                                        terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for
                                        enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
                                        enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are
                                        solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
                                        by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
                                        further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
                                        under this License.</p>

                                        <h3>5.0 Moral rights</h3>

                                        <p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights
                                        to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment
                                        that would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or
                                        any other derogatory treatment:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives
                                          all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest
                                          extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.4;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
                                          jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral
                                          rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the
                                          fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
                                          Section 10.4; and</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
                                          moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
                                          moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>

                                        <p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
                                        rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
                                        jurisdictions.</p>

                                        <h3>6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected</h3>

                                        <p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
                                        independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
                                        Database, including without limitation:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
                                          from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
                                          purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
                                          Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative
                                          or judicial procedure.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation
                                          or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>

                                        <p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract
                                        and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated
                                        quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including
                                        creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the
                                        Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or
                                        Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount
                                        to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
                                        Contents.</p>

                                        <h3>7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>

                                        <p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor “as is” and without any
                                        warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
                                        custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically
                                        disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
                                        non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of
                                        errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.
                                        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
                                        this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>

                                        <h3>8.0 Limitation of liability</h3>

                                        <p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,
                                        the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
                                        for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
                                        under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused
                                        by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of
                                        liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,
                                        consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,
                                        data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies
                                        even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
                                        damages.</p>

                                        <p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
                                        direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on
                                        the part of the Licensor.</p>

                                        <h3>9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</h3>

                                        <p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
                                        automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
                                        notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
                                        Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative

                                        under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided
                                        their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
                                        under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
                                        survive any termination of this License.</p>

                                        will not terminate Your rights under it.</p>

                                        <p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You
                                        for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.</p>

                                        <p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
                                        conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License
                                        will be reinstated:</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th
                                          day after cessation of breach;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless
                                          otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the
                                          violation, this is the first time You have received notice of
                                          violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the
                                          violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>

                                        <p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to
                                        be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.</p>

                                        <p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
                                        the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or
                                        making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different
                                        license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not
                                        withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
                                        required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
                                        License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
                                        stated above.</p>

                                        <p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
                                        unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of
                                        the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each
                                        remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the

                                        <p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with
                                        respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any
                                        earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
                                        the Database.</p>

                                        entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any
                                        breach by the Licensor.</p>

                                        <p>10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by
                                        the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
                                        sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under
                                        applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant
                                        jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,
                                        these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
                                        terms of this License.</p>

                                <p>Copyright 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                                 <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a></p><p>
                                 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                                 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

                                <h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

                                <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
                                software and other kinds of works.</p>

                                <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
                                to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
                                the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
                                share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
                                software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
                                GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
                                any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
                                your programs, too.</p>

                                <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                                them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
                                want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
                                free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

                                <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
                                these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
                                certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
                                you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

                                <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                                gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
                                freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
                                or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
                                know their rights.</p>

                                <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
                                (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
                                giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

                                <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
                                that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
                                authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
                                changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
                                authors of previous versions.</p>

                                <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
                                modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
                                can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
                                protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
                                pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
                                use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
                                have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
                                products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
                                stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
                                of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

                                <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
                                States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
                                software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
                                avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
                                make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
                                patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

                                <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                                modification follow.</p>

                                <p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

                                <p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
                                works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
                                 
                                <p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
                                License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
                                “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>

                                <p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
                                in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
                                exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
                                earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>

                                <p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
                                on the Program.</p>

                                <p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
                                permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
                                infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
                                computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
                                distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
                                public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

                                <p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
                                parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
                                a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

                                <p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
                                to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
                                feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
                                tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
                                extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
                                work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
                                the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
                                menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>

                                <p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
                                for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
                                form of a work.</p>

                                <p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
                                standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
                                interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
                                is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

                                <p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
                                than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
                                packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
                                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
                                Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
                                implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
                                “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
                                (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
                                (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
                                produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

                                <p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
                                the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
                                work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
                                control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
                                System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
                                programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
                                which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
                                includes interface definition files associated with source files for
                                the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
                                linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
                                such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
                                subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

                                <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
                                can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
                                Source.</p>

                                <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
                                same work.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

                                <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
                                copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
                                conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
                                permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
                                covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
                                content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
                                rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

                                <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
                                convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
                                in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
                                of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
                                with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
                                the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
                                not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
                                for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
                                and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
                                your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

                                <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
                                the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
                                makes it unnecessary.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

                                <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
                                measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
                                11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
                                similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
                                measures.</p>

                                <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
                                circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
                                is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
                                the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
                                modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
                                users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
                                technological measures.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

                                <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
                                receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
                                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
                                keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
                                non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
                                keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
                                recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

                                <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
                                and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

                                <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
                                produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
                                terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

                                <ul>
                                <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
                                    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

                                <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
                                    released under this License and any conditions added under section
                                    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
                                    “keep intact all notices”.</li>

                                <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
                                    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
                                    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                                    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                                    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
                                    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                                    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

                                <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
                                    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
                                    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
                                    work need not make them do so.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
                                works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
                                and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
                                in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
                                “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
                                used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
                                beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
                                in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
                                parts of the aggregate.</p>

                                <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
                                of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
                                machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
                                in one of these ways:</p>

                                    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
                                    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
                                    customarily used for software interchange.</li>

                                <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                                    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
                                    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
                                    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
                                    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
                                    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
                                    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
                                    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
                                    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
                                    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

                                <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
                                    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
                                    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
                                    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
                                    with subsection 6b.</li>

                                <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
                                    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                                    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
                                    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
                                    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
                                    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
                                    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
                                    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
                                    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
                                    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
                                    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
                                    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

                                <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
                                    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
                                    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
                                    charge under subsection 6d.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
                                from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
                                included in conveying the object code work.</p>

                                <p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
                                tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
                                or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
                                into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
                                doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
                                product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
                                typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
                                of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
                                actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
                                is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
                                commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
                                the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

                                <p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
                                procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
                                and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
                                a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
                                suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
                                code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
                                modification has been made.</p>

                                <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
                                specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
                                part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
                                User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
                                fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
                                Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
                                by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
                                if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
                                modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
                                been installed in ROM).</p>

                                <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
                                requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
                                for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
                                the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
                                network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
                                adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
                                protocols for communication across the network.</p>

                                <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
                                in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
                                documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
                                source code form), and must require no special password or key for
                                unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

                                <p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
                                License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
                                Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
                                be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
                                that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
                                apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
                                under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
                                this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

                                <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
                                remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
                                it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
                                removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
                                additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
                                for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

                                <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
                                add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
                                that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

                                <ul>
                                <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
                                    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

                                <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
                                    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
                                    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

                                <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
                                    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
                                    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

                                <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
                                    authors of the material; or</li>

                                <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
                                    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

                                <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                                    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
                                    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
                                    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
                                    those licensors and authors.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
                                restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
                                received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
                                governed by this License along with a term that is a further
                                restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
                                a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
                                License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
                                of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
                                not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

                                <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
                                must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
                                additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
                                where to find the applicable terms.</p>

                                <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
                                form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
                                the above requirements apply either way.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>

                                <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
                                provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
                                modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
                                this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
                                paragraph of section 11).</p>

                                <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
                                license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
                                provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
                                finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
                                holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
                                prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

                                <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                                reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                                violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                                received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                                copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                                your receipt of the notice.</p>

                                <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                                licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                                this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                                reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
                                material under section 10.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

                                <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
                                run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
                                occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
                                to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
                                nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
                                modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
                                not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
                                covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

                                <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
                                receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
                                propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
                                for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

                                <p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
                                organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
                                organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
                                work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
                                transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
                                licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
                                give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
                                Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
                                the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

                                <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
                                rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
                                not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
                                rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
                                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
                                any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
                                sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>

                                <p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
                                License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
                                work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</p>

                                <p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
                                owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
                                hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
                                by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
                                but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
                                consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
                                purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
                                patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
                                this License.</p>

                                <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
                                patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
                                make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
                                propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

                                <p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
                                agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
                                (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
                                sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a
                                party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
                                patent against the party.</p>

                                <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
                                and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
                                to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
                                publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
                                then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
                                available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
                                patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
                                consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
                                license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have
                                actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
                                covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
                                in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
                                country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
                                  
                                <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
                                arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
                                covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
                                receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
                                or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
                                you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
                                work and works based on it.</p>

                                <p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
                                the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
                                conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
                                specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
                                work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
                                in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
                                to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
                                the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
                                parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
                                patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
                                conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
                                for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
                                contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
                                or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

                                <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
                                any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
                                otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

                                <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
                                covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
                                not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
                                to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
                                the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
                                License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>

                                <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
                                permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
                                under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
                                combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
                                License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
                                but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
                                section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
                                combination as such.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

                                <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
                                the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                                address new problems or concerns.</p>

                                <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
                                Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
                                Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
                                option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
                                version or of any later version published by the Free Software
                                Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
                                GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
                                by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

                                <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
                                versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
                                public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
                                to choose that version for the Program.</p>

                                <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
                                permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
                                author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
                                later version.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

                                <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                                APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
                                HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
                                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
                                THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                                PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
                                IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
                                ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

                                <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
                                THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
                                GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
                                USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
                                DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
                                PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
                                EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
                                SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

                                <h4><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

                                <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
                                above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
                                reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
                                an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
                                Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
                                copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

                                <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

                                <h3><a name="howto"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

                                <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                                possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                                free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

                                <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                                to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                                state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                                the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

                                <pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

                                notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
